# Road Fatalities in Western Australia

This Data Base is created for Mainroads Western Australia to assess the number of crash fatalities experienced across WA.

This can be done by analysing the road speed limits, time of day and year, road user type and age group, number of fatalities per incident, involvement of trucks and buses, destination of the crash site.

The data should give insight into the infrastructure and  safety of our roads.
